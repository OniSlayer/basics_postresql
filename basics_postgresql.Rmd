```{python}
# To interact with postqre, the psycopg2 library is used
import psycopg2
```

```{python}
# To create a connection with the db, first you should be shure that the server is active and listening
# !pg_lsclusters 10 main start

```

```{python}
# Then you have to create a connection object to the server
conn = psycopg2.connect(
user="dum",
dbname="postgres",
host="/var/run/postgresql"
)
```

```{python}
# To perform queries or command to the db, you need a cursor
cur = conn.cursor()
```

```{python}
# Postgre automatically initiates a new transaction, so it's necessary to set the autocommit property of the connection to True
conn.commit()
conn.autocommit = True
```

```{python}
# To create a new database, use the following syntax
cur.execute('''
    create database basic_postgre owner dum
''')
```

```{python}
# To create tables, the syntax is the same that the one on SQLite
cur.execute('''
    create table data_test(
        id integer primary key,
        name text
    )
''')
```

```{python}
# Adding values to the recently created table
cur.execute('''
    insert into data_test
    values
        (1, 'Jose');

''')
```

```{python}
# To run queries, you have to use the methods fetchall or fetchone of the conn

cur.execute('''
    select *
    from data_test
''')

cur.fetchall()

```
